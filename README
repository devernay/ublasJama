This ublasJama 1.0.2.3, based on Jama 1.0.2

ublasJama is translation of the public domain Jama (Java Matrix
Package <http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/>) 1.0.2 to C++ using
boost.ublas for the linear algebra.

Author of the ublas translation: Frederic Devernay <frederic.devernay@m4x.org>

Documentation: see the Jama documentation <http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/doc/>.

Original Authors: see the Jama list of authors <http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/#Authors>.

No optimization of the original code was done, but the functionality is here:
    * Cholesky Decomposition of symmetric, positive definite matrices
    * LU Decomposition (Gaussian elimination) of rectangular matrices
    * QR Decomposition of rectangular matrices
    * Eigenvalue Decomposition of both symmetric and nonsymmetric square matrices
    * Singular Value Decomposition of rectangular matrices

There are two test programs:
- TestMatrix, in subdirectory test  - the original Jama tests, where only the relevant tests were kept.
- MagicSquareExample, in subdirectory examples

Changes since ublasJama 1.0.2.2:
- from http://ojalgo.org/generated/org/ojalgo/matrix/jama/package-summary.html:
 -"The getL() and getU() methods of the LU decomposition should be modified.
   Introduce a new parameter d that is the minimum of m and n.
   Use that to set the column dimension of L and the row dimension of U."
 - Add a method isSymmetric() that exposes the already existing field issymmetric
   in the EigenvalueDecomposition class.
- Check for bug http://cio.nist.gov/esd/emaildir/lists/jama/msg01528.html
  (bug was not present)
- check for bug http://cio.nist.gov/esd/emaildir/lists/jama/msg01525.html
  (bug was present and is *fixed* in EigenvalueDecomposition.cpp - see
  README-Eigenbug.txt for an explanation)
 
Changes since ublasJama 1.0.2.1:
- applied fixes and enhancements to SVD, based on Jama fixes by by Andreas Kyrmegalos:
  - explanation: http://cio.nist.gov/esd/emaildir/lists/jama/msg01430.html
  - final version: http://cio.nist.gov/esd/emaildir/lists/jama/msg01431.html

Changes since ublasJama 1.0.2.0:
- fix two bugs in SVD (the ublas matrix constructor doesn't init elts)
